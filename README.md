I've been frustrated w/ the state of Unity3D projects and tutorials available as most of them are outdated/broken.  It seems like things shouldn't be so hard.

In any case, I am putting together a set of tutorials (each in an individual scene that will hopefully make life easier for me and maybe others.

Starting w/ a Unity 5.2.2f1 Project.
